  <summary>I am glad to present my Poster at workshop on NBER NSF Time Series Conference 2025 at Rutgers University. This poster is based on joint work with Professor Sayar Karmakar and Professor Rangan Gupta.  In addition, my Ph.D. advisor Professor Dimitris Politis gave an invited talk based on our Bootstrap prediction inference of nonlinea autoregressive models.</summary>

  <summary>Abstract  In this work, we explore the forecasting ability of a recently proposed normalizing and variance-stabilizing (NoVaS) transforma-tion with the possible inclusion of exogenous variables in GARCH volatility specification. The NoVaS prediction method, whichis inspired by a model-free prediction principle, has generally shown more accurate, stable and robust (to misspecifications)performan...</summary>

  <summary>In my opinion, this work has a wide application on various scenrios involved neural network training.    Abstract  Deep neural networks (DNN) has received increasing attention in machine learning applications in the last several years. Recently, a non-asymptotic error bound has been developed to measure the performance of the fully connected DNN estimator with ReLU activation functions for esti...</summary>
