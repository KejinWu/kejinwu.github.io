<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at Loyola University Chicago.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to complete my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of California San Diego in 2025 under the supervision of <a href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~politis/">Dimitris N. Politis.</a></p>

<p>My research interests lie in the area of Time Series Analysis, 
Bootstrap/Subsampling, and Machine Learning methods, especially for their 
applications in prediction. My <a href="assets/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CV</a> is here.</p>

<p> I am open to collaboration. Please email me if you have interests about my research.

</p>
