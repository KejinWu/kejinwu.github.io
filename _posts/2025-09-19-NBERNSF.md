I am glad to present my [Poster](/assets/files/NBER_NSF_2025_Poster.pdf) at workshop on NBER NSF Time Series Conference 2025 at Rutgers University. This poster is based on joint work with Professor Sayar Karmakar and Professor Rangan Gupta.

In addition, my Ph.D. advisor Professor Dimitris Politis gave an invited talk based on our [Bootstrap prediction inference of nonlinea autoregressive models](/assets/files/Bootstrap_prediction_inference_of_nonlinea_autoregressive_models.pdf).
